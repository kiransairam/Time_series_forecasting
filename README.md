## Validation MAE Baseline: 0.96
## Validation MAE Tuned Fully connected model: 0.77
## Validation MAE lstm (Stacked) : 0.74
## Validation MAE for Conv1D model: 0.88

The LSTM model has a validation MAE of 0.74, which is the lowest validation MAE among all the models tried, indicating that it is the best model for this task.

On the other hand, the Conv1D model has a validation MAE of 0.88, which is lower than the baseline model but higher than the other two models. This indicates that the Conv1D model is performing better than the baseline model, but not as good as the other two models.
